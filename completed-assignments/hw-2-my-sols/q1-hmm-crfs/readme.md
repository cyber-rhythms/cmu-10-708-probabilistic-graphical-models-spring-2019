## Using hiddden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) for parts-of-speech tagging.

This directory contains the materials I produced as part of self-study when completing "Q1. Sequential models for POS tagging" of the assignment "10-708 PGM (Spring 2019): Homework 2 v1.1", whose rubric can be found [here](https://github.com/cyber-rhythms/cmu-10-708-probabilistic-graphical-models-spring-2019/blob/master/homework-assignments/hw-2/hw-2-v1.1.pdf).

## Directory contents.

1. `environment.yml` - for users wishing to run the code in a conda environment.
3. `requirements.txt` - for users wishing to run the code in a Python virtual environment. 
4. `pos-hmm.py` - script for training of and inference using a hidden Markov model.
5. `pos-linear-crf.py` - script for training and inference using a linear-chain conditional random field.
6. `/data` - contains tag set and vocabulary as `.txt` files; and training and test data as `.npy` files.
7. `/figures` - figures generated by the scripts.

## Getting started.

## Running the code.

## Directions for further exploration.
