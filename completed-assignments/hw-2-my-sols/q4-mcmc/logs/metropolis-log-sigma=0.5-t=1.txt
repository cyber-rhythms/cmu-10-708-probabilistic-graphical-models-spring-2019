Metropolis algorithm has concluded for this setting of the MCMC parameters.
After 5000 iterations of the Metropolis algorithm, autocorrelated samples of the parameters theta are: 
[[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 ...
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]]


The acceptance rate is: 0 accepted / 5000 total samples = 0.0
After thinning, and assuming that the Markov chain has converged to a stationary distribution that is the target/posterior distribution, the posterior samples of the parameters theta are: 
[[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
