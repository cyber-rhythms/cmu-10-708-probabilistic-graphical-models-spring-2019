## Posterior inference in a Bayesian hierarchical model using the Metropolis algorithm: Sports analytics of 2013-2014 Premier League goal data.

This directory contains the materials produced when completing "Q4: Markov Chain Monte Carlo" of the assignment "10-708 PGM (Spring 2019): Homework 2 v1.1". 

The assignment rubric is located [here](https://github.com/cyber-rhythms/cmu-10-708-probabilistic-graphical-models-spring-2019/blob/master/homework-assignments/hw-2/hw-2-v1.1.pdf).

The assignment is an adaptation of the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) to sports data for the 2013-2014 Premier League football results, rather than Italian Serie A results.
