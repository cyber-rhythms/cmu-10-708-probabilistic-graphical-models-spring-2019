## Junction-tree message passing implementations for inference in a toy Bayesian network; and for unsupervised parameter estimation in hidden Markov models (HMMs) with a toy dataset.

This directory contains the scripts I wrote as part of self-study when completing "Q3.3. Junction tree in action: part 2" and "Q4. Parameter learning" of the assignment "10-708 PGM (Spring 2019): Homework 1 v1.1". The assignment rubric can be found [here](https://github.com/cyber-rhythms/cmu-10-708-probabilistic-graphical-models-spring-2019/blob/master/assignments/hw-1/hw-1-v1.1.pdf).
