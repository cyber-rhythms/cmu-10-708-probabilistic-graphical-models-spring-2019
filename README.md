# CMU 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models Spring 2019 (Eric Xing)

A fully organised, integrity checked repo containing all the lecture materials available at:

https://sailinglab.github.io/pgm-spring-2019/lectures/

The course videos that accompany the contents of this repo are available here:

https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%220f44b4d7-fb4e-49eb-b88d-a9d00125e1b3%22&maxResults=50

The video playlist has been cross-checked against the coursepage for completeness. See remarks.

By folder, the repo contains:

1) 10-708-probabilistic-graphical-models-coursepage.html - an archived complete html document
that contains the course schedule, in case the link is no longer hosted by CMU.

2) 10-708-probabilistic-graphical-models-coursepage folder - the relevant html files for the
above complete html document. 

3) homework-assignments folder - contains 4 homework assignment materials.

4) lecture-slides folder - contains all the lecture slides in PDF form. File names have been
"cleaned" and associated with a date for ease of association to the main course page.

5) lecture-sldies-annotated folder - contains version of the lecture slides that have been
annotated by the instructor.

6) notes folder - a placeholder folder as a reminder that there exist notes scribed by students
of the course. These are all available as distil style blogs at the following link:

  https://sailinglab.github.io/pgm-spring-2019/notes/

  Each blog/lecture notes page is assembled from the following associated github repo:

  https://github.com/sailinglab/pgm-spring-2019

7) suggested-projects folder - contains an archived complete html webpage of the following link:

  https://sailinglab.github.io/pgm-spring-2019/project/

Remarks:

The reason for archiving course pages and to save the materials is to provide an additional location
for auto-didacts to download the materials, in the event that the sailing.github.io, for whatever
reason, no longer hosts the materials. In the past, some CMU courses have had their pages removed
after the semester has ended.

A copy of all the PDF readings for the course is not uploaded due to repo space constraints, but can
be downloaded by going to the coursepage, and failing that, Googling the titles.

"Lecture #21 Sequential decision marking (part 2): the algorithms" slides were not available from the coursepage as the link was broken.
However, the annotated version of these slides were available, so "lecture21-rl+pgm-pt2-maruan-03-apr-annotated.pdf"
has been placed in "lecture-slides" to reflect this.

"Lecture #5(skipped): Parameter learning in fully observable Bayesian Networks" video is not
in the playlist, as it was skipped, as indicated on the course page.
